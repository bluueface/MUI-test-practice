Question 3:

Define the weighted sum of an array to be 2 * the sum of the even valued elements + 3 * the sum of the odd valued elements.

Write a method named computeWeightedSum that computes the weighted sum of its argument.

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is
int computeWeightedSum(int[ ] a)

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is
int computeWeightedSum(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array a.

You may assume that the input parameter is not null and that it contains at least one element.

Your method must make only one pass through the array, i.e, there must be only one loop in your method!
